ðŸ§ª Overview of the 7 Experiments
#	Experiment	Variable Tested	Hypothesis
1	Augmentation vs No Augmentation	Data augmentation	Augmented training improves accuracy and F1.
2	Pretrained vs Not Pretrained	Model initialization	Using pretrained ImageNet weights converges faster and achieves higher accuracy.
3	Batch Size	16 vs 64	Smaller batches may generalize better; larger ones train faster but risk overfitting.
4	Learning Rate	1e-3 vs 1e-4	Optimal learning rate yields higher validation accuracy.
5	Optimizer Type	Adam vs SGD	Different optimizers affect convergence and stability.
6	B/W vs RGB Input	1-channel grayscale vs 3-channel color	Color cues help detect rain more accurately.
7	Hardware Accelerator	CPU vs GPU vs TPU	GPU/TPU drastically cut training time with similar accuracy.
