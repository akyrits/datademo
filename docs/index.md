# PawSense AI: Detecting Dog Emotion with AlexNet

Welcome! This site documents my project using **AlexNet** to classify dog emotional state from images (e.g., happy vs. sad / stressed).

This website is organized into:

- **[Problem & Motivation](problem.md)** – Why this problem matters for dogs and humans.
- **[Technical Approach (AlexNet)](approach.md)** – How I applied AlexNet to my dataset.
- **[Visualizations, Results, & Takeaways](results.md)** – Plots, screenshots, and what I learned.

## Quick Project Overview

Many dog owners miss subtle stress signals like:

- Pinned ears
- Lip licking and yawning
- “Whale eye” (white of the eye showing)
- Tense mouth and body posture

These signals are easy to overlook in real time but are important for **welfare and safety**.

This project explores whether a **convolutional neural network (AlexNet)** can learn to distinguish **happy vs. sad/stressed** dogs from images, based on a labeled dataset that I prepared in this repository.
