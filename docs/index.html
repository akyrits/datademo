      Detecting happy vs. stressed dogs from images using AlexNet and transfer learning.

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Dogs often show subtle signs of stress or anxiety—pacing, lip licking, pinned ears,
        or avoiding eye contact—long before humans notice a “behavior problem.”
        By the time we see barking, destruction, or withdrawal, the dog may have been
        uncomfortable for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, pet cameras and smart collars are becoming common, but they mostly
        track <strong>where</strong> the dog is, not <strong>how</strong> the dog feels.
        There is an opportunity to use computer vision to support better, earlier detection of stress.

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Animal welfare:</strong> Help owners catch stress early and respond with training or environment changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical deployment:</strong> A lightweight CNN could run on existing pet cameras or apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning goal:</strong> Apply transfer learning with AlexNet to a real-world dataset.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project explores whether a fine-tuned AlexNet can reliably distinguish
        <strong>happy</strong> vs. <strong>stressed/anxious</strong> dogs from still images.

      <h2>Project Scope</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Task: binary image classification – happy vs. stressed dogs.</li>
        <li>Input: single RGB dog image resized to 224×224.</li>
        <li>Output: predicted class + confidence score.</li>
      </ul>

        in more depth.
