         PROBLEM & MOTIVATION
         ========================= -->
    <div class="section-card" id="problem">
      <h2>Problem & Motivation</h2>

      <p>
        Dogs often communicate stress and discomfort long before humans recognize there is a problem. 
        Subtle cues like pinned ears, “whale eye”, stress panting, or a tucked tail can appear well 
        before overt behaviors like barking, growling, destruction, or withdrawal.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, pet cameras and smart devices are becoming common in homes, but they mainly track 
        <strong>where</strong> a dog is and <strong>how much</strong> it moves, not <strong>how it feels</strong>. 
        There is an opportunity to use computer vision to support earlier detection of canine stress.
      </p>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Animal welfare:</strong> Help owners notice stress early and adjust training, environment, or routine.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Many bite incidents and reactivity issues are preceded by visible stress signals.</li>
        <li><strong>Shelter impact:</strong> Dogs in stressful environments may decline behaviorally if early signs are missed.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        PawSense AI explores whether a fine-tuned AlexNet model can reliably distinguish 
        <strong>happy</strong> vs. <strong>stressed/sad</strong> dogs from images as a first step toward real-time monitoring.

         DATASET OVERVIEW
         ========================= -->
    <div class="section-card">
      <h2>Dataset & Labeling</h2>

      <p>
        I built a small but balanced dataset of dog images labeled into two classes:
        <strong>Happy</strong> and <strong>Stressed/Sad</strong>. Images come from a mix of breeds, lighting conditions,
        and environments to avoid overfitting to a single “type” of dog.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets so I can tune hyperparameters without “peeking”
        at final performance.
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Class</th>
            <th>Train</th>
            <th>Validation</th>
            <th>Test</th>
            <th>Total</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Happy</td>
            <td>50</td>
            <td>40</td>
            <td>36</td>
            <td>126</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Stressed / Sad</td>
            <td>50</td>
            <td>40</td>
            <td>36</td>
            <td>126</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="total-row">
            <td><strong>All images</strong></td>
            <td><strong>100</strong></td>
            <td><strong>80</strong></td>
            <td><strong>72</strong></td>
            <td><strong>252</strong></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        Keeping the classes balanced makes it easier to interpret accuracy and prevents the model
        from “cheating” by always predicting the majority class.
      </p>

         ALEXNET APPROACH

    <div class="section-card" id="approach">
      <h2>What the Model Sees</h2>
      <p>Examples of the types of images used during training:</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h2>Image Preprocessing Pipeline</h2>
      <p>Before entering AlexNet, each image goes through a structured preprocessing pipeline:</p>

      <div class="pipeline">
        <div class="pipeline-step">Raw dog image</div>
        <span class="pipeline-arrow">➜</span>
        <div class="pipeline-step">Resize to 227×227</div>

        <div class="pipeline-step">Feed into AlexNet</div>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resize:</strong> images are resized to 227×227×3.</li>
        <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> scale pixel values to match ImageNet statistics.</li>
        <li><strong>Tensor conversion:</strong> convert images into PyTorch tensors.</li>
        <li><strong>Augmentation:</strong> random flips, small rotations, and brightness jitter to improve robustness.</li>

      <h2>AlexNet Architecture (Short Version)</h2>

      <!-- Architecture diagram (update filename if needed) -->
      <img src="assets/alexnet_architecture.png" class="img-wide" alt="AlexNet Architecture Diagram" />

      <p>
        AlexNet is a convolutional neural network originally designed for large-scale image classification. 
        In this project, it serves as a feature extractor for canine facial expressions and body cues.
      </p>

      <h3>Feature Extractor</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conv1:</strong> 96 filters, 11×11 kernel, stride 4 → ReLU → MaxPool</li>
        <li><strong>Conv2:</strong> 256 filters, 5×5 kernel → ReLU → MaxPool</li>
        <li><strong>Conv3:</strong> 384 filters, 3×3 kernel → ReLU</li>
        <li><strong>Conv4:</strong> 384 filters, 3×3 kernel → ReLU</li>
        <li><strong>Conv5:</strong> 256 filters, 3×3 kernel → ReLU → MaxPool</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Custom Classifier Head</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Flatten features from the last convolutional layer.</li>
        <li>Two fully connected layers with ReLU + dropout.</li>
        <li>Final fully connected layer with <strong>2 outputs</strong> (Happy, Stressed).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h2>Transfer Learning Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Training a deep CNN from scratch on a small dog-emotion dataset would overfit quickly.
        Instead, I use transfer learning with AlexNet pretrained on ImageNet.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Initialize the model with pretrained ImageNet weights.</li>
        <li>Use the convolutional stack as a fixed or lightly fine-tuned feature extractor.</li>
        <li>Replace the original 1000-class output layer with a new 2-class classifier.</li>
        <li>Train the classifier layers first, then optionally fine-tune deeper layers with a smaller learning rate.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This leverages generic visual features (edges, textures, shapes) learned from millions of images and adapts them to the
        “happy vs stressed” dog dataset.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h2>Training Configuration</h2>
      <p>
        I experimented with several training setups in Google Colab, focusing on how optimizer, learning rate, batch size, 
        and device (CPU vs GPU) affected performance.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Settings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Loss:</strong> Cross-entropy loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimizers tested:</strong> Adam and SGD.</li>
        <li><strong>Batch sizes:</strong> 16 and 32.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning rates:</strong> 1e-4 and 1e-5 for fine-tuning.</li>
        <li><strong>Epochs:</strong> ~15–30 with early stopping based on validation loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Input mode:</strong> RGB images (grayscale variants performed worse).</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> CPU vs GPU (CUDA) runs for comparison.</li>
      </ul>

        The best-performing configuration uses pretrained AlexNet with an Adam optimizer, learning rate

        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Test accuracy</td>
            <td>≈ 0.93</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Happy precision</td>
            <td>≈ 0.93</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Stressed precision</td>
            <td>≈ 0.93</td>

          <tr class="total-row">
            <td><strong>Overall impression</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Consistently high performance on a small dataset</strong></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        The confusion matrix shows that most mistakes are between visually subtle cases where “happy” and
        “stressed” body language overlap (e.g., panting dogs with partially tense faces).

      <h2>Takeaways & Next Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Transfer learning with AlexNet works well even on a relatively small, balanced dog-emotion dataset.</li>
