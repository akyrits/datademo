    <h1>PawSense AI: Real-Time Dog Emotion Detection</h1>

    <p class="abstract">
      PawSense AI evaluates whether transfer learning with a pretrained AlexNet model can
      distinguish happy versus stressed dog expressions from everyday images. Using a small but
      balanced dataset and a series of controlled training experiments, the project explores the
      feasibility of early stress detection as a potential feature for pet-camera or veterinary
      technology platforms.

      experimental results for this project.

  <!-- Problem Overview -->
  <section id="problem" class="padded-section">

      <h2>Problem Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Dogs frequently display emotional and physiological stress signals subtly—flattened ears,
        widened eyes, whale-eye, tucked tail, lip licking, or a frozen posture. Many of these cues
        occur long before barking, whining, or other obvious signs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, owners often miss these early signals. Chronic stress in dogs has been
        linked to behavioural issues, reduced quality of life, and worsening anxiety. Without tools
        to flag early stress, problems may only be noticed once behaviour has already escalated.
      </p>

      <p>
        This creates an opportunity for a computer-vision model capable of identifying stress cues
        in real time from everyday images, such as those captured by phones or pet cameras.

      <h2>Motivation</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Pet owners increasingly rely on cameras and smart devices to monitor pets.</li>
        <li>Stress and anxiety frequently go undetected until severe behaviour emerges.</li>
        <li>No widely available model exists that can distinguish dog emotional states from simple RGB images in everyday environments.</li>
        <li>AI-driven early detection could improve training decisions, well-being, and owner awareness.</li>
        <li>Long-term goal: integrate stress detection into pet cameras, mobile apps, or vet-tech workflows.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="summary-box">
        <h3>Why This Problem Matters</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Early stress detection could prevent worsening anxiety and behaviour issues.</li>
          <li>Provides actionable insights to owners during normal day-to-day life, not just at the vet or trainer.</li>
          <li>Combines modern computer vision with a real-world, high-impact pet-care application.</li>

      <h2>Quick Project Overview</h2>

      <p>
        To tackle this problem, PawSense AI uses a convolutional neural network called
        <strong>AlexNet</strong>, fine-tuned via transfer learning on a small, balanced dataset
        of labeled dog images (happy vs. stressed/sad).
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Images are resized, normalised, and lightly augmented before training.</li>
        <li>AlexNet’s pretrained layers act as a feature extractor for dog faces and body posture.</li>
        <li>A new classifier head predicts whether each image is more consistent with a
          <strong>happy/relaxed</strong> dog or a <strong>stressed/anxious</strong> dog.</li>
      </ul>
