    <h1>PawSense AI: Real-Time Dog Emotion Detection</h1>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Alexander Kyritsopoulos<br />
       <strong>Course:</strong> Deep Learning Project</p>

    <p>
      PawSense AI explores whether transfer learning using AlexNet can detect
      <strong>dog emotional states</strong>—specifically
      <em>happy/relaxed</em> vs. <em>stressed/anxious</em>—directly from images.
      The broader goal is to evaluate whether deep learning can help pet owners
      better understand their dog’s well-being through early detection of stress.

  <section id="problem" class="padded-section">
    <h2>Problem Overview</h2>

    <p>
      Dogs frequently display emotional and physiological stress signals subtly—
      flattened ears, widened eyes, whale-eye, tucked tail, lip licking, or a
      frozen posture. Many of these cues occur long before barking, whining, or
      other obvious signs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, owners often miss these early signals. Chronic stress in dogs
      has been linked to behavioral issues, reduced quality of life, and worsening
      anxiety. Without tools to flag early stress, problems may only be noticed
      once behavior has already escalated.
    </p>

    <p>
      This creates an opportunity for a computer-vision model capable of identifying
      stress cues in real time from everyday images, such as those captured by
      phones or pet cameras.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Pet owners increasingly rely on cameras and smart devices to monitor pets.</li>
      <li>Stress and anxiety frequently go undetected until severe behavior emerges.</li>
      <li>
        No widely available model exists that can distinguish dog emotional states
        from simple RGB images in everyday environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        AI-driven early detection could improve training decisions, well-being, and
        owner awareness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Long-term goal: integrate stress detection into pet cameras, mobile apps,
        or vet-tech workflows.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="summary-box">
      <h3>Why This Problem Matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Early stress detection could prevent worsening anxiety and behavior issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides actionable insights to owners during normal day-to-day life,
          not just at the vet or trainer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combines modern computer vision with a real-world, high-impact pet-care
          application.

  <h2>Project Summary</h2>

  <p>
    PawSense AI applies a convolutional neural network (AlexNet) to classify dog images
    into two emotional states: <strong>happy/relaxed</strong> and
    <strong>stressed/anxious</strong>. The model is fine-tuned via transfer learning
    on a small, balanced dataset of labeled dog images.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Images are resized, normalized, and lightly augmented before being passed to the model.
    </li>
    <li>
      AlexNet’s pretrained convolutional layers act as a feature extractor for facial
      expressions and body posture.
    </li>
    <li>
      A custom classifier head produces a binary prediction for the dog’s emotional state.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Detailed model architecture, preprocessing, and training configuration are documented on the
    <a href="approach.html">AlexNet Approach</a> page. Visualizations, evaluation metrics,
    and key findings are presented on the
    <a href="results.html">Results &amp; Takeaways</a> page.
