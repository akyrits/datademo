    <h1>PawSense AI: Detecting Stress & Emotional States in Dogs</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      A CNN-based approach using transfer learning with AlexNet.

    <div class="section-card">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Dogs frequently display subtle signs of stress—pacing, lip licking, pinned ears, 
        whale eye, a stiff posture—long before humans perceive a “behavior problem.”
        Many dog bite and shelter intake cases are preceded by unrecognized stress signals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pet tech (cameras, collars, trackers) is increasing in popularity, 
        but these systems measure <strong>location</strong> and <strong>activity</strong>, not <strong>emotional state</strong>.
        A vision-based stress detection system could help owners respond earlier 
        and promote stronger human–animal relationships.

      <h2>Project Scope</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Binary classification: <strong>Happy</strong> vs <strong>Stressed/Anxious</strong>.</li>
        <li>Input: single image resized to 224×224.</li>
        <li>Output: predicted class + confidence score.</li>
        <li>Model: transfer learning with pretrained AlexNet.</li>
      </ul>
