    <h1>PawSense AI: Real-Time Dog Emotion Detection</h1>
    <p class="abstract">
  PawSense AI evaluates whether transfer learning with a pretrained AlexNet model can
  distinguish happy versus stressed dog expressions from everyday images. Using a small but
  balanced dataset and a series of controlled training experiments, the project explores the
  feasibility of early stress detection as a potential feature for pet-camera or veterinary
  technology platforms.

  experiment results.

  <!-- Problem -->
  <section id="problem" class="padded-section">
    <h2>Problem Overview</h2>

    <p>
      Dogs frequently display emotional and physiological stress signals subtly—
      flattened ears, widened eyes, whale-eye, tucked tail, lip licking, or a
      frozen posture. Many of these cues occur long before barking, whining, or
      other obvious signs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, owners often miss these early signals. Chronic stress in dogs
      has been linked to behavioral issues, reduced quality of life, and worsening
      anxiety. Without tools to flag early stress, problems may only be noticed
      once behavior has already escalated.
    </p>

    <p>
      This creates an opportunity for a computer-vision model capable of identifying
      stress cues in real time from everyday images, such as those captured by
      phones or pet cameras.

  <section id="motivation" class="padded-section">
    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Pet owners increasingly rely on cameras and smart devices to monitor pets.</li>
      <li>Stress and anxiety frequently go undetected until severe behavior emerges.</li>
      <li>
        No widely available model exists that can distinguish dog emotional states
        from simple RGB images in everyday environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        AI-driven early detection could improve training decisions, well-being, and
        owner awareness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Long-term goal: integrate stress detection into pet cameras, mobile apps,
        or vet-tech workflows.

    </ul>

      <h3>Why This Problem Matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Early stress detection could prevent worsening anxiety and behavior issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides actionable insights to owners during normal day-to-day life,
          not just at the vet or trainer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combines modern computer vision with a real-world, high-impact pet-care
          application.

  <h2>Project Summary</h2>

  <p>
    PawSense AI applies a convolutional neural network (AlexNet) to classify dog images
    into two emotional states: <strong>happy/relaxed</strong> and
    <strong>stressed/anxious</strong>. The model is fine-tuned via transfer learning
    on a small, balanced dataset of labeled dog images.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Images are resized, normalized, and lightly augmented before being passed to the model.
    </li>
    <li>
      AlexNet’s pretrained convolutional layers act as a feature extractor for facial
      expressions and body posture.
    </li>
    <li>
      A custom classifier head produces a binary prediction for the dog’s emotional state.
    </li>
  </ul>
