# Problem & Motivation

## Real-World Problem

Dog body language can be subtle. Many owners struggle to recognize early signs of:

- **Stress**
- **Fear**
- **Anxiety**

Instead, they often only notice behavior once it escalates into:

- Barking, lunging, or growling
- “Sudden” nips or bites
- Avoidance or shutdown behavior

This is a welfare and safety issue:

- Dogs may live in **chronic stress** without humans realizing it.
- Humans misinterpret signals as “stubborn” or “disobedient.”
- Miscommunication contributes to **behavior problems** and **shelter surrender**.

## Why It Matters

Early detection of stress makes it easier to:

- Change the **environment** (more distance, enrichment, decompression time).
- Work with **trainers or behavior professionals**.
- Talk with a **veterinarian** about medical causes of stress or pain.

Better understanding of dog emotion improves:

- **Human–dog relationships**
- **Safety** around children and visitors
- **Quality of life** for family pets and shelter dogs

## Data Science + Deep Learning Opportunity

Can we train a **deep learning model** to recognize emotional states in dog images?

- Dogs show emotions through **ears, eyes, muzzle, and posture**.
- These patterns are **visual** and often nuanced.
- This makes them a good fit for **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**.

## Project Goal

Use **AlexNet**, a classic CNN, to classify images of dogs into emotional categories like:

- **Happy** vs **Sad/Neutral**
- Or **Relaxed** vs **Stressed/Anxious**

The long-term vision is a tool that could:

- Assist owners with **real-time emotion feedback**.
- Help shelters and veterinarians **monitor stress** more objectively.
- Serve as a foundation for an **AI-powered companion app** for dog guardians.
